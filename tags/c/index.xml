      <description>This is a chess engine built using C. This is the same code that is found in the tutorial however, I have structured the code into separate folders and updated the makefile for ease of use. Can be used alongisde arena
 Installation  Run the make file in a terminal using this command:
 make TODO  Follow this video on his channel which is technically the last VICE/chess engine video add static modifier to functions which are only used in the file in which they are declared add const/final to variables which wont be changed inside certain functions (when doing so do some testing so that the program works correctly)</description>

      <title>Choosing a programming language</title>

      <description>Although I will be talking about high level languages I think this post applies to all types of programming languages.
When programming everyone struggles to choose a specific programming language to code in but choosing a language to code in is easier than it seems. In my experience choosing a language mainly depends on what you want to do for the coding project you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen.
For instance, if you are making a CLI application, there is no need to use a language like python or java as it adds unnecessary overhead to the application.</description>

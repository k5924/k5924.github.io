      <description>I recommend a student account as there are many deals on overdrafts that students can get and many banks provide students incentives to use their student account, if you already have a bank account you can most likely just upgrade your account to a student account with your current bank either over the phone or in branch, this will not affect your bank account details so if you are being paid by student finance into this account their shouldnâ€™t be an issue with the payments going into the account.</description>

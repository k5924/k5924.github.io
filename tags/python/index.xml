      <description>This is an offline password manager as most online password managers store a users information on centralized servers. This gives an end user the ability to take control of how there data is being used and allows end users&#39; to keep hold of their private data whilst interacting with a password manager with an easy to use interface. This project was made for coursework while i was in my 2nd Year of studying Computer Science at LSBU for the Software Engineering module.</description>

      <description>Although I will be talking about high level languages I think this post applies to all types of programming languages.
When programming everyone struggles to choose a specific programming language to code in but choosing a language to code in is easier than it seems. In my experience choosing a language mainly depends on what you want to do for the coding project you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen.
For instance, if you are making a CLI application, there is no need to use a language like python or java as it adds unnecessary overhead to the application.</description>

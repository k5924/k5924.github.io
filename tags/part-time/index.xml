      <description>There are lots of benefits to apprenticeships and part-time jobs but I would like to discuss which is best for you while attending university.
Apprenticeships were introduced as a way for students to attend University and not be worried about not being able to afford to go to University as you would be earning money from your job while studying for your degree. However, this is very similar to a student getting a part-time job alongside university as you could use the income from your part-time job towards tuition fees.</description>

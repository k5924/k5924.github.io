      <description>This is an offline password manager as most online password managers store a users information on centralized servers. This gives an end user the ability to take control of how there data is being used and allows end users&#39; to keep hold of their private data whilst interacting with a password manager with an easy to use interface. This project was made for coursework while i was in my 2nd Year of studying Computer Science at LSBU for the Software Engineering module.</description>

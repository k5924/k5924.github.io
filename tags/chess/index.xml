      <description>This is a chess engine built using C. This is the same code that is found in the tutorial however, I have structured the code into separate folders and updated the makefile for ease of use. Can be used alongisde arena

 make TODO  Follow this video on his channel which is technically the last VICE/chess engine video add static modifier to functions which are only used in the file in which they are declared add const/final to variables which wont be changed inside certain functions (when doing so do some testing so that the program works correctly)</description>

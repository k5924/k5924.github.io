      <description>Although I will be talking about high level languages I think this post applies to all types of programming languages.
When programming everyone struggles to choose a specific programming language to code in but choosing a language to code in is easier than it seems. In my experience choosing a language mainly depends on what you want to do for the coding project you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen.
For instance, if you are making a CLI application, there is no need to use a language like python or java as it adds unnecessary overhead to the application.</description>
